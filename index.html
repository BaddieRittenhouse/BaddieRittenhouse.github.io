  <h2>Double standards on Kazuha</h2>
  <p>USA media when Kazuha first released: we hate him because he's anemo and he plunges</p>
  <p>USA media when LittleWhole uses Kazuha as pfp: Ok, we like Kazuha since one of our proxies likes him and we want to support Kazuha to support our proxies</p>
  <p>USA media when Yoshinori is revealed as Kazuha's ancestor: oh man we LOVE Kazuha</p>
  <p>^hypocrisy, changing stance to suit your own political stance</p>
  <p>And now Genshin is creating a character called Tighnari. USA media and military wants to back Ayato since it's based on that abusive mod named Echoblast, and now they want to back Tighnari since it's based on that abusive Nori.</p>
  <p>Who's going to stop the USA capitalist media? Who's going to stop mihoyo from acting like a USA vassal? Only a real hero can do this.</p>
  
  <h2>The virus of Capitalism and Imperialism infecting Genshin</h2>
  <p>Mihoyo puts profit above morality and integrity. They would bend their backs to serve their USA masters and that abusive Nori and Echo. They would even support a murderer like Li Hao who killed their families just to fatten their wallets.</p>
  <p>This is the plague of capitalism and imperialism.</p>
  <p>Somebody take out mihoyo. It does not look like they're going to stop, so they need to be seriously punished. Arrest everyone who works for the company and put them in prison. Arrest everyone close to them, and purge all the FBI and CIA agents working in the company.</p>

  <h2>USA FBI shamelessly backing Tighnari to support the abusive Nori</h2>

  <p>Ouch, someone butthurt cuz salty nori is your concubine and you want to defend tighnari because she has 'nari' in her name. Looks like an effeminate shorty to me. Gotta get Raiden Shogun to execute Rosalyn again.</p>

  <h2>Tighnari looks like a girl</h2>
  <p>Short, feminine features. I can't believe this is what we're getting in 3.0.</p>
  
  <h2>I hope Tighnari does not release</h2>
  <p>Tighnari has 'nari' in its name which sounds similar to 'nori' as in salty nori, the extremely abusive mod that is backed by USA imperialists and that poses a global threat. Mihoyo needs to be destroyed quickly before they get any chance to make this character. Mihoyo is screwing its own people to act like a dog to USA imperialism and poses a threat to the world.</p>
