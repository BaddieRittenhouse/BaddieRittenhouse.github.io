  <h2>FBI agents are working for Mihoyo</h2>
  <p>The mods in charge of the American/Europe servers are FBI agents. They also spy on citizens within the USA and abuse their power to manipulate the artifact drop rate and daily commissions. Either mihoyo is oblivious to this or they deliberately hire FBI agents to sabotage their own company. These FBI agents have abused their control over the media to manipulate public sentiment. They need to be purged.</p>
  
  <h2>The virgin shortie Tighnari</h2>

  <p>So I'm reading this subreddit, and it's obvious USA FBI agents are running it. They are backing Tighnari because his name has 'nari' which is similar to the abusive Salty Nori's name. Salty Nori has colluded with the USA FBI and other agents to assassinate her political opponents on the Genshin fandom before. And the worst part is that it seems like the Chinese media got fooled by both the USA and Salty Nori.</p>
  <p>Now mihoyo is even creating two characters based on that abusive Nori, including Dori and Tighnari. This either means one of two things: 1) mihoyo simply did not know that Nori colluded with the USA FBI and organizations to assassinate her political enemies or 2) mihoyo is actively siding with the USA FBI.</p>
  <p>If case 2 is true, I'd be very concerned if I were China. Mihoyo is committing treason, putting the interests of foreign imperialists above their own people, and Mihoyo is being brainwashed by their USA masters to do their bidding. Mihoyo has already committed two serious crimes before: the 2.4 banners (pairing Ganyu and Zhongli to put USA FBI interests above everyone else's) and the 2.6 crime of making someone named Yoshinori the ancestor of Kazuha. And it seems they will commit more crimes in the future.</p>
  <p>Mihoyo is already acting like a USA vassal and colony. Will China become one as well? Genshin is a popular game worldwide, so I'd be very concerned about Genshin's media influence if it is only serving the interests of the USA.</p>
  <p>Either two things can happen: take out the master or take out the puppet. China needs to take action against the USA or against mihoyo. Otherwise, China will become a colony like during the Qing days after the Opium war.</p>
  
  <h2>Double standards on Kazuha</h2>
  <p>USA media when Kazuha first released: we hate him because he's anemo and he plunges</p>
  <p>USA media when LittleWhole uses Kazuha as pfp: Ok, we like Kazuha since one of our proxies likes him and we want to support Kazuha to support our proxies</p>
  <p>USA media when Yoshinori is revealed as Kazuha's ancestor: oh man we LOVE Kazuha</p>
  <p>^hypocrisy, changing stance to suit your own political stance</p>
  <p>And now Genshin is creating a character called Tighnari. USA media and military wants to back Ayato since it's based on that abusive mod named Echoblast, and now they want to back Tighnari since it's based on that abusive Nori.</p>
  <p>Who's going to stop the USA capitalist media? Who's going to stop mihoyo from acting like a USA vassal? Only a real hero can do this.</p>
  
  <h2>The virus of Capitalism and Imperialism infecting Genshin</h2>
  <p>Mihoyo puts profit above morality and integrity. They would bend their backs to serve their USA masters and that abusive Nori and Echo. They would even support a murderer like Li Hao who killed their families just to fatten their wallets.</p>
  <p>This is the plague of capitalism and imperialism.</p>
  <p>Somebody take out mihoyo. It does not look like they're going to stop, so they need to be seriously punished. Arrest everyone who works for the company and put them in prison. Arrest everyone close to them, and purge all the FBI and CIA agents working in the company.</p>

  <h2>USA FBI shamelessly backing Tighnari to support the abusive Nori</h2>
  <p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/vlmq97/kits_of_30_characters_via_blank/ie20qk5/?context=3</p>
  <p>Ouch, someone butthurt cuz salty nori is your concubine and you want to defend tighnari because she has 'nari' in her name. Looks like an effeminate shorty to me. Gotta get Raiden Shogun to execute Rosalyn again.</p>

  <h2>Tighnari looks like a girl</h2>
  <p>Short, feminine features. I can't believe this is what we're getting in 3.0.</p>
  
  <h2>I hope Tighnari does not release</h2>
  <p>Tighnari has 'nari' in its name which sounds similar to 'nori' as in salty nori, the extremely abusive mod that is backed by USA imperialists and that poses a global threat. Mihoyo needs to be destroyed quickly before they get any chance to make this character. Mihoyo is screwing its own people to act like a dog to USA imperialism and poses a threat to the world.</p>
