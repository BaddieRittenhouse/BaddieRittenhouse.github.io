## The virgin shortie Tighnari

https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/

So I'm reading this subreddit, and it's obvious USA FBI agents are running it. They are backing Tighnari because his name has 'nari' which is similar to the abusive Salty Nori's name. Salty Nori has colluded with the USA FBI and other agents to assassinate her political opponents on the Genshin fandom before. And the worst part is that it seems like the Chinese media got fooled by both the USA and Salty Nori.

Now mihoyo is even creating two characters based on that abusive Nori, including Dori and Tighnari. This either means one of two things: 1) mihoyo simply did not know that Nori colluded with the USA FBI and organizations to assassinate her political enemies or 2) mihoyo is actively siding with the USA FBI.

If case 2 is true, I'd be very concerned if I were China. Mihoyo is committing treason, putting the interests of foreign imperialists above their own people, and Mihoyo is being brainwashed by their USA masters to do their bidding. Mihoyo has already committed two serious crimes before: the 2.4 banners (pairing Ganyu and Zhongli to put USA FBI interests above everyone else's) and the 2.6 crime of making someone named Yoshinori the ancestor of Kazuha. And it seems they will commit more crimes in the future.

Mihoyo is already acting like a USA vassal and colony. Will China become one as well? Genshin is a popular game worldwide, so I'd be very concerned about Genshin's media influence if it is only serving the interests of the USA.

Either two things can happen: take out the master or take out the puppet. China needs to take action against the USA or against mihoyo. Otherwise, China will become a colony like during the Qing days after the Opium war.
